To use it:\n\n1. Select the two attributes which contain the geocoded coordinates of your nodes (latitude and longitude)\n2. Select the projection you want to use\n3. Set the other parameters according to the selected projection\n4. Launch the algorithm\n\nThe available projections are:\n\n* [Mercator](http://bit.ly/JQuvw)\n* [Tranverse Mercator](http://bit.ly/btWRTI)\n* [Miller cylindrical](http://bit.ly/agJOxd)\n* [Gall-Peters](http://bit.ly/Nj5cW)\n* [Sinusoidal](http://bit.ly/a8SsNg)\n* [Lambert cylindrical](http://bit.ly/cnuxqr)\n* [Winkel Tripel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkel_tripel_projection)\n* [Equirectangular](http://bit.ly/vxEmy)\n\nFor any questions or just more information, you can check the related [thread](http://bit.ly/a6itGZ) on the Gephi forum.\n\nAnd if, for any reason, some of your nodes do not have valid values on the selected attributes (for latitude and longitude), they will be displayed on a line on the bottom of your graph (then, you can delete them or do what you want). Also make sure your latitude and longitude columns are of type \u0027double\u0027, not \u0027string\u0027.\n",

  "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>The purpose of the Graph Streaming API is to build a unified framework for streaming graph objects. Gephi’s data structure and visualization engine has been built with the idea that a graph is not static and might change continuously. By connecting Gephi with external data-sources, we leverage its power to visualize and monitor complex systems or enterprise data in real-time. Moreover, the idea of streaming graph data goes beyond Gephi, and a unified and standardized API could bring interoperability with other available tools for graph and network analysis, as they could start to interoperate with other tools in a distributed and cooperative fashion.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Owner’s Notes</h3>\n<p>With the increasing level of connectivity and cooperation between systems, for a system that aim to be interoperable, it is imperative to comply with the available standards. Graph objects are abstractions that can represent a wide range of real-world structures, from computer networks to human interactions, and there are a lot of standards to exchange graph data in different formats, from text-based formats to xml-based formats. But the real-world structures are constantly changing, and the current formats are not suitable to exchange such type of dynamic data.</p>\n<p>A lot of well-established systems already stream data to its users using a streaming API. Twitter for example defined a Streaming API to allow near-realtime access to its data. They are using two different formats: XML and JSON, but JSON is strongly encouraged over XML, as JSON is more compact and parsing is greatly simplified.</p>\n<p>We are not the first to implement a Graph Streaming API, and another very interesting experience is the GraphStream Java Library. It is composed of an API that gives a way to add edges and nodes in a graph and make them evolve. The graphs are composed of nodes and edges that can appear, disappear or be modified, and these operations are called events. The sequence of operations that occur in a graph is seen as a stream of events.</p>\n<p>So, as other people already had successful experiences with graph streaming, why not start our work based on these experiences? That’s what we are doing, and beyond finding these experiences very useful, we are also trying to be compatible with the available work. This Gephi Graph Streaming release is using two formats: JSON for flexibility, and a text-based format, based in the GraphStream implementation.</p>\n<p>To illustrate how simple it will be to connect to a master, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SW_FDiY0sg\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> shows Gephi connecting to a master and visualizing the received graph data in real time. The graph in this demo is a part of the Amazon.com library, where the nodes represent books and the edges represent their similarities. For each book, a node is added, the similar books are explored, adding the similar ones as nodes and the similarity as an edge.</p>\n<p>The Graph Streaming specification goes beyond the simple fact that a client can pull data from a master: in fact, clients can interact with the master pushing data to it, in a REST architecture. The same data format used by the master to send graph events to the clients is used by clients to interact with the master.</p>\n<p>But what about connecting two different Gephi instances together? One instance will be master, and the other client. Using the Graph Streaming API, a change in a graph at the master’s workspace should cause a change in the client’s workspace, and a change at the client’s workspace will cause it to send requests to the master to update its graph accordingly. Both instances working in a distributed mode. In fact, different people could work in a distributed mode to construct a graph: it’s the Collaborative Graph Construction.</p>"

You can choose which entities, and which relations, form the network.</p>\n<p><strong><em>New since plugin version 1.4: you can create dynamic networks if your Excel file includes a column with a year or date indication.</em></strong></p>\n<h2>1. Quick how-to</h2>\n<p>- Install the plugin in Gephi (File -&gt; Tools -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Available).<br>\n- Restart Gephi</p>\n<p>In the Gephi menu, select File -&gt; Import Spigot.<br>\n- Select “Data importer”<br>\n- Get your Excel file ready!<br>\n- Follow the steps of the wizard.</p>\n<h2>2. To go further…</h2>\n<p>The plugin gives you the possibility to create network of two types of entities. Let’s say that your Excel file looks like:</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"80\" height=\"20\"><strong>Author</strong></td>\n<td width=\"80\"><strong>Book</strong></td>\n<td width=\"80\"><strong>Year</strong></td>\n<td width=\"300\"><strong>Sales of the book</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td height=\"20\">David</td>\n<td>My life</td>\n<td>1972</td>\n<td>350 copies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td height=\"20\">Mary</td>\n<td>My story</td>\n<td>1968</td>\n<td>400 copies</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the wizard you’ll get to a window where you’ll select “Author” and “Book” as the two types of entities you want to connect:</p>\n<p>(click to enlarge)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bipartite.jpg?022bbc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5762\" alt=\"bipartite\" src=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bipartite-300x241.jpg?022bbc\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\"></a></p>\n<p>And the result in Gephi will be:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/network-bipartite.jpg?022bbc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5763\" alt=\"network bipartite\" src=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/network-bipartite-300x189.jpg?022bbc\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\"></a></p>\n<p>This looks fantastic, <strong>but in practice this type of networks gets quickly messy</strong> – lots of connections between both types of agents, making it hard to disentangle and to visualize.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-&gt; For this reason, I’d suggest to also try the plugin on this type of files:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"80\" height=\"20\"><strong>Author</strong></td>\n<td width=\"80\"><strong>Book</strong></td>\n<td width=\"80\"><strong>Year</strong></td>\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Sales of the book</strong></td>\n<td width=\"300\"><strong>Literary agent</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td height=\"20\">David</td>\n<td>My life</td>\n<td>1972</td>\n<td>350 copies</td>\n<td>Philip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td height=\"20\">Mary</td>\n<td>My story</td>\n<td>1968</td>\n<td>&nbsp;400 copies</td>\n<td>Philip</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here, by selecting a network made of ‘Authors’ and ‘Literary Agent’ in the plugin, the resulting network will be much more interesting (because it is made of one type of agents: persons).</p>\n<p>So in the plugin you select (click to enlarge):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tttt.jpg?022bbc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5764\" alt=\"tttt\" src=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tttt-300x241.jpg?022bbc\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And this leads to something more meaningful, in my opinion at least:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/network.jpg?022bbc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5761\" alt=\"network\" src=\"https://marketplace.gephi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/network-300x188.jpg?022bbc\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3. Dynamics: what are the correct formats for time?</h2>\n<p>You need a column that includes indications of time. Several possibilties:</p>\n<h3>1) Years or dates</h3>\n<p>Dates must be formatted in yyy-mm-dd: <strong>2012-06-27</strong><br>\nYears are just yyyy: <strong>1968</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2) Durations or single values:</h3>\n<p>- Durations are just a start and end time separated with a comma:&nbsp;<strong>2012-06-27,2014-01-01</strong><br>\nOr for a duration in years: <strong>1958, 1999</strong></p>\n<p>- single values are, well: just a year: <strong>1876</strong> or just a date: <strong>1879-03-19</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. Issues and feature requests?</h2>\n<p>Please post your comments and questions on Github:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/seinecle/My-Plugins-for-Gephi/issues\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/seinecle/My-Plugins-for-Gephi/issues</a></p>\n<p>I am Clement Levallois (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/seinecle\" target=\"_blank\">@seinecle</a>), Assistant Professor at EMLYON Business School, and you can see my other projects on <a href=\"http://www.clementlevallois.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.clementlevallois.net</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. Release history</h2>\n<p>Initial release (Nov. 2013).</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 (Nov. 2013). Added error messages helping the user navigate the plugin.</p>\n<p>Version 1.3 (March 2014). Bug fix: same names in different columns are now treated correctly. Bug report / analysis by Wouters A.H. Spekkink.</p>\n<p>Version 1.4 (September 2014). Time dimension added: if your file includes a column with a time stamp, the nodes and edges will be created at this time. Durations also possible. More info in the wizzard included in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Version 1.4.1 (September 2014). Bug fix: time intervals can now include spaces after the comma: “2013-05-13, 2013-05-14″ (previously, only&nbsp;”2013-05-13,2013-05-14″ would have worked.) Bug report by Anne van Summeren.</p>\n<p>Version 1.4.2 (September 2014). Bug fix: the names of entities to be connected had to be textual in Excel : “45″ would not be a correct value. Version 1.4.2 corrects that and adds minor bug fixes. Bug report by Prem Sankar C.</p>\n<p>Version 1.4.3 (November 2014). Bug fix: Null pointer exception when nodes have empty values. Bug report by Xin Xin of University of North Texas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
