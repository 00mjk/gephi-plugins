${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}    Notice
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
${licensePrefix}of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
${licensePrefix}the two main principles guiding its drafting:
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}    * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
${licensePrefix}      of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
${licensePrefix}      users,
${licensePrefix}    * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
${licensePrefix}      it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
${licensePrefix}      intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
${licensePrefix}      both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}The authors of the CeCILL-C (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre])
${licensePrefix}license are:
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}Commissariat ï¿½ l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical
${licensePrefix}and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of
${licensePrefix}business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
${licensePrefix}and technological establishment, having its principal place of business
${licensePrefix}at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}    Preamble
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
${licensePrefix}the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make
${licensePrefix}available to the community the modifications made to the source code of
${licensePrefix}the software so as to contribute to its evolution.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
${licensePrefix}modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
${licensePrefix}with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
${licensePrefix}economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
${licensePrefix}and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
${licensePrefix}the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
${licensePrefix}complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
${licensePrefix}developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
${licensePrefix}knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
${licensePrefix}suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
${licensePrefix}enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
${licensePrefix}more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
${licensePrefix}security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
${licensePrefix}provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
${licensePrefix}removed herefrom.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
${licensePrefix}the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

${licensePrefix}opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
${licensePrefix}legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
${licensePrefix}shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
${licensePrefix}any or all compensation from the Licensor.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}    Article 9 - WARRANTY
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
${licensePrefix}state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
${licensePrefix}possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
${licensePrefix}possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
${licensePrefix}attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
${licensePrefix}modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
${licensePrefix}reserved for experienced users.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
${licensePrefix}the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
${licensePrefix}order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
${licensePrefix}or properties.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
${licensePrefix}to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
${licensePrefix}rights set forth in Article 5).
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
${licensePrefix}the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
${licensePrefix}that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
${licensePrefix}as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
${licensePrefix}nature.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
${licensePrefix}from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
${licensePrefix}be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
${licensePrefix}configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
${licensePrefix}Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
${licensePrefix}relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
${licensePrefix}the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
${licensePrefix}arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
${licensePrefix}instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
${licensePrefix}Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
${licensePrefix}the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
${licensePrefix}assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
${licensePrefix}decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
${licensePrefix}Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
${licensePrefix}disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
${licensePrefix}name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
${licensePrefix}prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
${licensePrefix}of a trademark.

${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}    Article 10 - TERMINATION
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
${licensePrefix}hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
${licensePrefix}thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
${licensePrefix}remained ineffective.
${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
${licensePrefix}authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
${licensePrefix}licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
${licensePrefix}shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
${licensePrefix}with the terms and conditions hereof.

${licensePrefix}      11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS

${licensePrefix}
${licensePrefix}11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
${licensePrefix}conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
${licensePrefix}said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
${licensePrefix}the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
${licensePrefix}text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
